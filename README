GitHub hook designed to keep Git projects with submodules automatically in sync with their submodules.
Simply put if a submodule S has a branch Sb and the containing project P has a branch Pb with the same name (Sb = Pb) then the submodule commit pointer in P will be updated to HEAD for Pb and commited.

This is Sinatra application and requires:

sinatra
birkirb-git
rcov, rspec, cucumber and webrat for testing.
